# Auburn-Code

Just looking to archive some of my old projects from uni. Shoutout to everyone that helped me get through those times!

We coded in everything from java to F#. Organizing these will help me to remember some lost skills hopefully, and if it helps anybody else out there trying to figure out a project then that'll be an added benefit!

something... something... I was young then...
